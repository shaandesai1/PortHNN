# PortHNN
Port-Hamiltonian Neural Networks for Learning Explicit Time-Dependent Dynamical Systems

We show that an embedded Port-HNN in neural networks is significantly more performant than existing approaches at learning from explicit, non-autonomous time-dependent physical systems.

To run this code, all you need is torch.

cd into the main directory, then type in:

'''
./runner_files_reg/run_all_methods.sh 
'''

It will run all methods.

A separate file is designated for the coupled system and runs in its own jupyter notebook.
